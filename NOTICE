According to https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-%28apache-2.0%29, I need to:

- [x] Include Copyright [LICENSE](LICENSE)
- [x] Include License [LICENSE](LICENSE)
- [x] State changes (see below)
- [x] Include NOTICE (this file) when you distribute. Not sure whether forking on GitHub is 
  the same as distributing, but the NOTICE is here anyway.

*Changes*

- Work with OpenHAB v1/v2 *and* v3
- Nodes were postfixed with a `2` to prevent collision with the original module.
